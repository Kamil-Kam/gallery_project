The working website can be seen here:

The website is loading slowly due to the free hosting that I am using.

This is my first web project created using the Django and Bootstrap frameworks. It's a photo gallery featuring my travel photos with short descriptions. The photos are organized into appropriate folders, and users can also upload their own photos to the Visitors Photos folder.
<br>
<br>
As the administrator, I can create new categories and upload my photos in the Django admin panel, where suitable models are located.
<br>
<br>
To prevent spam uploads, I have implemented an anti-spam blocker that restricts users to uploading only three images per two minutes for each IP address.
<br>
<br>
To ensure the website works correctly, I have created basic tests for every view and model used.
