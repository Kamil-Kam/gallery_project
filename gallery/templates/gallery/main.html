                On this webpage, I am showcasing my photographic repertoire, captured during my travels. Predominantly, these are picturesque landscapes, panoramas,
                and wildlife shots. Many of them feature colorful sunsets and sunrises, which render the most stunning visual delights for photography
                enthusiasts.
            </p>
            <p>
                Each tab on the left leads to a gallery of images on a specific theme..Furthermore, visitors have the option to upload their own photographs, which
                will be allocated to the "Visitors photos" directory and automatically resized to a maximum dimension of 1920px on the larger side.
            </p>
            <p>
                All the photographs have been taken using the Nikon D3300 camera, paired with the Nikon Nikkor AF-S DX 18-140 mm f/3.5-5.6G ED VR lens. Below, you
                can find a concise description and a photograph of the equipment.
            </p>

            <p class="center">Nikon D3300</p>
            <p>
                The black Nikon D3300 DSLR camera is lightweight and adaptable, with a 24.2 megapixel CMOS sensor in DX format and an EXPEED 4 image engine.
                High-resolution imagery, notable low-light sensitivity to an expanded ISO 25600, continuous shooting at 5 frames per second, and Full HD 1080p video recording
                capabilities are all made possible by the sensor and CPU working together.
            </p>

            <p>
                The sensor design also does not include the conventional optical low-pass filter to achieve the highest level of sharpness and resolution
                in photographs and videos.
                An 11-point autofocus system that offers rapid and precise focusing capabilities to suit working with various subject types in almost any lighting situation supports
                these image assets. Additionally, various shooting options are available to aid in artistically enhancing your photography.
                A big 3.0″ (921k-dot) LCD monitor is offered for live view monitoring, image playback, and menu navigation.
                It has a broad 160° viewing angle to accommodate better working from high and low angles.
                The optional WU-1a Wireless Mobile Adapter can enable Wi-Fi access for wirelessly transmitting imagery and remotely managing the camera from a connected Android or
                iOS mobile device, further expanding the viewing and shooting capabilities of the D3300.
            </p>

            <p>
                The AF-S DX NIKKOR 18-55mm f/3.5-5.6G VR II lens, a standard zoom offering a 35mm-equivalent focal length range of 27-82.5mm, is included with
                the D3300 camera body.
                A powerful VR image stabilization feature built into this lens helps to reduce camera shake by up to four shutter speed steps, which is beneficial when shooting
                in low light. A rounded seven-blade diaphragm helps to produce an appealing out-of-focus look in photos with a shallow depth of field.
                At the same time, Super Integrated Coating lowers flare and ghosting to maximize image clarity, contrast, and color neutrality.

            <p class="center">Nikkor 18-140mm</p>
                <p>
                    The Nikon 18-140mm ƒ/3.5-5.6 is Nikon's latest ''kit'' lens, sold optionally with the D5XXX and D7XXX series of digital SLR camera. The lens is designed to
                    fit a camera with an APS-C (''subframe'') sensor, so while it will mount on Nikon film or FX digital bodies, it will show obvious vignetting when
                    set to any focal length. The lens appears to replace the older 18-135mm lens, which did not come equipped with VR image stabilization.

                </p>

                <p>
                    Small and light, the 18-140mm represents a field of view of approximately 27-210mm in 35mm terms. To economize and create a more efficient design, the
                    lens is equipped with a variable aperture; as the zoom extends the focal length, both the largest and smallest apertures change. The following
                    chart represents the largest and smallest apertures you can expect at a given focal length:
                    The 18-140mm ƒ/3.5-5.6 provides very sharp results, at least as good as its recent contemporaries and better than previous designs in the same focal
                    length range.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Perhaps the best word to describe the sharpness profile of the 18-140mm is 'consistent'. With most zoom lenses, especially in the ''kit'' category, the designer
                    must juggle a variety of factors, not the least of which is the cost of the design. Frequently a lens will be a good wide-angle performer, only to
                    suffer when used at full telephoto; or, vice versa. This is not the case with the 18-140mm, which shows excellent performance at all focal lengths.
